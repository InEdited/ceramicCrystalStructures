# ceramicCrystalStructures
A small college project made by Unity Game engine that explores the various Ceramic crystal structures

-Currently can only take one Anion&Cation and display their crystal structure in a rotatable object to examine it, the Anion/Cation size is also interactive ( it changes size according to the ion's radius)
-Can expand the structure to be examined further



==================
# TO-DO
==================

-Fix some bugs with the Octahedral Crystal structure with the Pivot Point and expansion
-Add a better UI
-Adding some Graphical aids in the main scene
-Adding a check for corner cases where the Ratio between ions size is not Possible in a real life application
-Separating +ve/-ve databases
